# Dutch-Travel-Advices

## Notes:
Because I rely on the natural earth data, specificically the [admin 1](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/), the disputed territories and the populated places, this makes it harder to perfectly mirror the maps made by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore I have made a list of all countries where this is not (yet) perfect.

### Japan
* A small area near Fukushima should be red.

### North Macedonia
* The northern border should be yellow.
