# Dutch-Travel-Advices

This is a hobby project to visualize the travel advices given by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as learning more about creating maps (using geopandas) and creating gifs (using imageio).

This is not in any way linked to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs (sorry for scraping your website!).

Sources for the maps:
* [The travel advice maps that can be found through this page](https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/help/in-welke-taal-communiceert-welk-land).
* [The twitter page of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://twitter.com/247BZ). This was relevant, because I wanted some older data which in most cases they had.

## Notes:
Because I rely on the natural earth data, specificically the [admin 1](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/10m-admin-1-states-provinces/), the disputed territories and the populated places, this makes it harder to perfectly mirror the maps made by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Therefore I have made a list of all countries where this is not (yet) perfect.

### Bolivia
* Small area should be changed

### China
* The region Aksai Chin shows up in the maps of both Pakistan, China and India. Because it is de facto governed by China, the travel advice on the China page is chosen. This no endorsement.

### India
* The region Aksai Chin shows up in the maps of both Pakistan, China and India. Because it is de facto governed by China, the travel advice on the China page is chosen. This no endorsement.


### Iran
* Individual cities should be added
* Over time has not been incoorperated yet.

### Japan
* A small area near Fukushima should be red.

### Libia
* A lot should be changed still

### Marocco
* Add individual cities

### North Macedonia
* The northern border should be yellow.

### Pakistan
* The region Aksai Chin shows up in the maps of both Pakistan, China and India. Because it is de facto governed by China, the travel advice on the China page is chosen. This no endorsement.
